Description: Compute ranking and rating based on competition results. Methods of
    different nature are implemented: with fixed Head-to-Head structure, with
    variable Head-to-Head structure and with iterative nature. All algorithms
    are taken from the book 'Whoâ€™s #1?: The science of rating and ranking' by
    Amy N. Langville and Carl D. Meyer (2012, ISBN:978-0-691-15422-0).
