#' Massey method
#'
#' Functions to compute rating and ranking using Massey method.
#'
#' @param cr_data Competition results in format ready for
#'   [as_longcr()][comperes::as_longcr()].
#' @param ties Value for `ties` in [round_rank()].
#' @param round_digits Value for `round_digits` in [round_rank()].
#'
#' @details This rating method was initially designed for games between two
#' players. That is why competition results are transformed into pairwise games
#' `cr_pair` via [to_pairgames()][comperes::to_pairgames()]. Data from `cr_pair`
#' is used in rating computation.
#'
#' It is assumed that score is numeric and higher values are better for the
#' player.
#'
#' Computation is done based only on the games between players of interest (see
#' Players). __Note__ that all those players should be present in `cr_pair`
#' because otherwise there will be an error during solving linear system
#' described below. Message is given if there are players absent in `cr_pair`.
#'
#' The outline of Massey rating method is as follows:
#'
#' 1. Compute Massey matrix: diagonal elements are equal to number of games
#' played by certain player, off-diagonal are equal to minus number of common
#' games played. This matrix will be the matrix of system of linear equations
#' (SLE).
#'
#' 1. Compute right-hand side of SLE as cumulative score differences of players,
#' i.e. sum of all scores _for_ the player minus sum of all scores _against_ the
#' player.
#'
#' 1. Make adjustment for solvability of SLE. Modify the last row of Massey
#' matrix so that all its cells are equal to 1. Also change the last cell in
#' right-hand side to 0. This adjustment ensures that sum of all outcome ratings
#' will be 0.
#'
#' 1. Solve the SLE. The solution is the Massey rating.
#'
#' @section Players:
#'
#' `comperank` offers a possibility to handle certain set of players. It is done
#' by having `player` column (in [longcr][comperes::as_longcr] format) as factor
#' with levels specifying all players of interest. In case of factor the result
#' is returned only for players from its levels. Otherwise - for all present
#' players.
#'
#' @return `rate_massey()` returns a named vector of the Massey rating. The
#' sum of all ratings should be equal to 0.
#'
#' `rank_massey()` returns a named vector of [ranking][rating-ranking] using
#' [round_rank()].
