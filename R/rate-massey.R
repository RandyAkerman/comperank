#' Massey rating
#'
#' Function to compute rating using Massey method.
#'
#' @param cr_data Competition results in format ready for
#'   \code{\link[=results-longcr]{to_longcr}}.
#' @param players Vector of players for which rating is computed.
#'
#' @details This rating method was initially designed for games between two
#'   players. That is why competition results are transformed into pairwise
#'   games \code{cr_pair} via \link{to_pairgames}. Data from \code{cr_pair} is
#'   used in rating computation.
#'
#'   It is assumed that score is numeric and higher values are better for
#'   the player.
#'
#'   Computation is done based only on the games between players in argument
#'   \code{players}. If \code{NULL} then all players present in \code{cr_pair}
#'   are used. \bold{Note} that all \code{players} should be present in
#'   \code{cr_pair} because otherwise there will be an error during solving
#'   linear system described below. Message is given if there are players absent
#'   in \code{cr_pair}.
#'
#'   The outline of Massey rating method is as follows:
#'   \enumerate{
#'     \item Compute Massey matrix: diagonal elements are equal to number of
#'       games played by certain player, off-diagonal are equal to minus number
#'       of common games played. This matrix will be the matrix of system of
#'       linear equations (SLE);
#'     \item Compute right-hand side of SLE as cumulative score differences of
#'       players, i.e. sum of all scores \emph{for} the player minus sum of all
#'       scores \emph{against} the player;
#'     \item Make adjustment for solvability of SLE. Modify the last row of
#'       Massey matrix so that all its cells are equal to 1. Also change the
#'       last cell in right-hand side to 0. This adjustment ensures that sum of
#'       all outcome ratings will be 0;
#'     \item Solve the SLE. The solution is the Massey rating.
#'   }
#'
#' @return Named vector of the Massey rating. The sum of all ratings should be
#'   equal to 0.
