#' @details This rating method was initially designed for games between two
#' players. That is why competition results are transformed into pairwise games
#' `cr_pair` via [to_pairgames()][comperes::to_pairgames()]. Data from `cr_pair`
#' is used in rating computation.
#'
#' It is assumed that score is numeric and higher values are better for the
#' player.
#'
#' Computation is done based only on the games between players of interest (see
#' Players). __Note__ that it isn't necessary for all players of interest to be
#' present in `cr_pair` but it might be a good idea in order to obtain plausible
#' outcome rating.
#'
#' The outline of the Colley method is as follows:
#'
#' 1. Compute Colley matrix: diagonal elements are equal to number of games
#' played by certain player _plus 2_, off-diagonal are equal to minus number of
#' common games played. This matrix will be the matrix of system of linear
#' equations (SLE).
#'
#' 1. Compute right-hand side of SLE as 1 + 0.5*("number of player's wins" -
#' "number of player's losses").
#'
#' 1. Solve the SLE. The solution is the Colley rating.
#'

#'
#' @return `rate_colley()` returns a named vector of the Colley rating. The mean
#' rating should be 0.5.
#'
#' `rank_colley()` returns a named vector of [ranking][rating-ranking] using
#' [round_rank()].
