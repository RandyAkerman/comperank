#' @details This rating method was initially designed for games between two
#' players. That is why competition results are transformed into pairwise games
#' \code{cr_pair} via \link{to_pairgames}. Data from \code{cr_pair} is used in
#' rating computation.
#'
#' It is assumed that score is numeric and higher values are better for the
#' player.
#'
#' Computation is done based only on the games between players of interest (see
#' Players). \bold{Note} that it isn't necessary for all players of interest
#' to be present in \code{cr_pair} but it might be a good idea in order to
#' obtain plausible outcome rating.
#'
#' The outline of the Colley method is as follows:
#' \enumerate{
#'   \item Compute Colley matrix: diagonal elements are equal to number of
#'     games played by certain player \emph{plus 2}, off-diagonal are equal to
#'     minus number of common games played. This matrix will be the matrix of
#'     system of linear equations (SLE);
#'   \item Compute right-hand side of SLE as 1 + 0.5*("number of player's
#'     wins" - "number of player's losses");
#'   \item Solve the SLE. The solution is the Colley rating.
#' }
#'

#'
#' @return \code{rate_colley} returns a named vector of the Colley rating. The
#' mean rating should be 0.5.
#'
#' \code{rank_colley} returns a named vector of \link[=rating-ranking]{ranking}
#' using \code{\link{round_rank}}.
