\value{
\code{rate_od} returns a matrix with rows named by players and the
  following three columns:
  \itemize{
    \item \code{off} - offensive rating of players;
    \item \code{def} - defensive rating of players;
    \item \code{od} - Offense-Defense rating of players;
  }

  \code{rank_od} returns a matrix of the same structure as \code{rate_od} but
  with \link[=rating-ranking]{rankings} using \code{\link{round_rank}}.

\description{
Functions to compute rating and ranking using Offense-Defense method.

\details{
Offense-Defense (OD) rating is designed for games in which player's
  goal is to make higher score than opponent(s). To describe competition
  results Head-to-Head matrix is used (which is computed with \code{h2h_fun}
  via \code{\link{get_h2h}}). Element in row \bold{i} and column \bold{j}
  should represent the score player from column \bold{j} makes in games with
  player from row \bold{i}. For pairs of players without common games
  Head-to-Head value is computed to 0 (not \code{NA}). \bold{Note} that
  values should be non-negative and non-NA. This can be ensured with setting
  \code{force_nonneg_h2h} to \code{TRUE}.

  For player which can make \emph{high} score (even against the player with
  strong defense) it is said that he/she has \bold{strong offense} which
  results into \emph{high} offensive rating. For player which can force their
  opponents into making \emph{low} score (even if they have strong offense)
  it is said that he/she has \bold{strong defense} which results into
  \emph{low} defensive rating.

  Offensive and defensive ratings describe different skills of players. In
  order to fully rate players OD ratings are computed: offensive ratings
  divided be defensive. The more OD rating the better the player.

  Algorithm for OD ratings is as follows:
  \enumerate{
    \item Add small value to Head-to-Head matrix to ensure convergence of the
      iterative algorithm in the next step. If all values are strictly
      positive then this step is omitted. In other case small value is
      computed as the smallest non-zero Head-to-Head value multiplied by
      \code{eps};
    \item Perform iterative fixed point search with the following recurrent
      formula: \code{def_{k+1} = A \%*\% inv(t(A) \%*\% inv(def_{k}))} where
      \code{def_{k}} is a vector of defensive ratings at iteration \code{k},
      \code{A} is a perturbed Head-to-Head matrix, \code{inv(x) = 1 / x}.
      Iterative search stops if at least one of two conditions is met:
      \itemize{
        \item \code{sum(abs(def_{k+1} / def_{k} - 1)) < tol};
        \item Number of iterations exceeds maximum number of iterations
          \code{max_iterations}.
      }
    \item Compute offensive ratings: \code{off = t(A) \%*\% inv(def)};
    \item Compute OD ratings: \code{OD = off / def}.
  }
