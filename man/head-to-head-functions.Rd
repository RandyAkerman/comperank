\arguments{
\item{cr_data}{Competition results in format ready for
\code{\link[=results-longcr]{to_longcr}}.}

\item{players}{Vector of players for which Head-to-Head is computed.}

\item{absent_players}{Function which performs actions on Head-to-Head matrix
dealing with players which absent in \code{cr_data}.}

\item{absent_h2h}{Function which performs actions on Head-to-Head matrix
dealing with absent Head-to-Head records for some pairs of players.}

\item{...}{Additional arguments to be passed to or from methods.}

\item{matchup_data}{Data of matchups described in \link{head-to-head} as
input for specific \code{h2h_fun}.}

\code{h2h_num_wins}.}

\code{get_h2h_*} return \link[=head-to-head]{Head-to-Head matrices}.

All \code{h2h_*} are implementations of \code{h2h_fun} and return a single
Head-to-Head value.

\details{
This is a list of currently implemented \code{h2h_fun}s:
\describe{
  \item{h2h_mean_score_diff}{Computes mean score difference of \code{player2}
    compared to \code{player1};}
  \item{h2h_mean_score}{Computes mean score of \code{player2};}
  \item{h2h_sum_score_diff}{Computes sum of score differences of
    \code{player2} compared to \code{player1};}
  \item{h2h_sum_score}{Computes sum of scores of \code{player2};}
  \item{h2h_num_wins}{Computes number of matchups \code{player2} scored
    \bold{more} than \code{player1}. If \code{half_for_draw} is \code{TRUE}
    then it also adds half number of matchups where they had draw.
    \bold{Note} that it excludes matchups of the players with themselves.}
}

All \code{get_h2h_*} are wrappers around \code{\link[=head-to-head]{get_h2h}}
for using a specific \code{h2h_fun}.
