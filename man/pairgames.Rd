\usage{
to_pairgames(cr_data)

is_pairgames(cr_data)
}
\arguments{
\item{cr_data}{Competition results in format ready for
\code{\link[=results-longcr]{to_longcr}}.}
}
\value{
\code{to_pairgames} returns a competition results of pairwised games
  as \link[=results-widecr]{widecr} object with two players.

  \code{is_pairgames} returns a boolean value of whether \code{cr_data}
  contains only games between two players.

Functions for competition results with games between two players.

\details{
Pairgames is a term for competition results with games between two
  players.

  \code{to_pairgames} is a function that converts competition results
  into pairwise games: it drops games with one player and for every game with
  3 and more players this function transforms it into set of separate games
  between unordered pairs of players. In other words the result is a set of
  unordered \link[=head-to-head-helpers]{matchups} (as different games)
  between different players.

  \bold{Note} that order in which players are assigned to \code{player1} or
  \code{player2} column in general shouldn't agree with any order in
  \code{cr_data}.

  \bold{Note} that any column except \code{game}, \code{player} and
  \code{score} will be dropped after conversion to
  \code{\link[=results-longcr]{longcr}}.

  \bold{Note} that in order for this function to work, column \code{player}
  after conversion to \code{\link[=results-longcr]{longcr}} should be
  comparable, i.e. function '<' can be used properly on its values (which is
  true in most real-world cases).
